# VL.TextEditor.HDE

A small Editor Plugin for vvvv gamma that allows to visualize the content of an IOBox in code-editor-like window. It's pretty limited for now but should be handy to quickly visualize web API responses or shader code.

## Usage

- Clone this repo in your `packages-repositories` folder
- Build the solution in `Release` mode
- Start vvvv with `--package-repositories`
- Look for the help patch in the help browser
